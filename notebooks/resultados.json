To understand the effects of chemotherapy and immunotherapy we conducted a phase II frontline trial (n = 47) sequentially adding pembrolizumab to 5-FU\/platinum in advanced GEA. Using serial biopsy of the primary tumor at baseline, after one cycle of 5-FU\/platinum, and after the addition of pembrolizumab we transcriptionally profiled 358,067 single cells to identify evolving multicellular TME networks. Chemotherapy induced early on-treatment multicellular hubs with tumor-reactive T-cell and M1-like macrophage interactions in slow progressors. Faster progression featured increased MUC5A and MSLN containing treatment-resistance programs in tumor cells and M2-like macrophages with immunosuppressive stromal interactions. After pembrolizumab we observed increased CD8 T-cell infiltration and development of an immunity hub involving tumor-reactive CXCL13 T-cell program and epithelial interferon-stimulated gene programs. Strategies to drive increases in anti-tumor immune hub formation could expand the portion of patients benefiting from anti-PD1 approaches.","keywords":[],"journal":"Cancer discovery","publication_date":1707177600000,"authors":[{"lastname":"An","firstname":"Minae","initials":"M","affiliation":"Samsung Medical Center, Sungkyunkwan University School of Medicine, Seoul, Korea (South), Republic of."},{"lastname":"Mehta","firstname":"Arnav","initials":"A","affiliation":"Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston, MA, United States."},{"lastname":"Min","firstname":"Byung Hoon","initials":"BH","affiliation":"Samsung Medical Center, Seoul, Korea (South), Republic of."},{"lastname":"Heo","firstname":"You Jeong","initials":"YJ","affiliation":"Neocella, Seoul, Korea (South), Republic of."},{"lastname":"Wright","firstname":"Samuel J","initials":"SJ","affiliation":"Broad Institute, United States."},{"lastname":"Parikh","firstname":"Milan","initials":"M","affiliation":"Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard, United States."},{"lastname":"Bi","firstname":"Lynn","initials":"L","affiliation":"Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard, United States."},{"lastname":"Lee","firstname":"Hyuk","initials":"H","affiliation":"Samsung Medical Center, Seoul, Korea (South), Republic of."},{"lastname":"Kim","firstname":"Tae Jun","initials":"TJ","affiliation":"Samsung Medical Center, Sungkyunkwan University School of Medicine, Seoul, Korea, Seoul, Korea (South), Republic of."},{"lastname":"Lee","firstname":"Song-Yi","initials":"SY","affiliation":"Seoul National University, Seoul, Korea (South), Republic of."},{"lastname":"Moon","firstname":"Jeonghyeon","initials":"J","affiliation":"Yale University, New Haven, CT, United States."},{"lastname":"Park","firstname":"Ryan J","initials":"RJ","affiliation":"The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, United States."},{"lastname":"Strickland","firstname":"Matthew R","initials":"MR","affiliation":"Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston, MA, United States."},{"lastname":"Park","firstname":"Woong-Yang","initials":"WY","affiliation":"Samsung Medical Center, Seoul, Korea (South), Republic of."},{"lastname":"Kang","firstname":"Won Ki","initials":"WK","affiliation":"Samsung Medical Center, Sungkyunkwan University School of Medicine, Seoul, Korea (South), Republic of."},{"lastname":"Kim","firstname":"Kyoung-Mee","initials":"KM","affiliation":"Samsung Medical Center, Sungkyunkwan University School of Medicine, Seoul, Korea (South), Republic of."},{"lastname":"Kim","firstname":"Seung Tae","initials":"ST","affiliation":"Samsung Medical Center, Sungkyunkwan University School of Medicine, Seoul, Korea (South), Republic of."},{"lastname":"Klempner","firstname":"Samuel J","initials":"SJ","affiliation":"Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston, MA, United States."},{"lastname":"Lee","firstname":"Jeeyun","initials":"J","affiliation":"Samsung Medical Center, Sungkyunkwan University School of Medicine, Seoul, Korea (South), Republic of."}],"methods":null,"conclusions":null,"results":null,"copyrights":null,"doi":"10.1158\/2159-8290.CD-23-0857","xml":{"attrib":{},"tag":"PubmedArticle","tail":null,"text":null}}}

Previously, we have shown the role of CAGE in resistance to chemotherapy and target therapy. The aim of this study was to investigate the role of CAGE in osimertinib resistance and determine the prognostic value of CAGE in patients with pulmonary adenocarcinomas. The clinicopathological correlation with CAGE and autophagy flux in patients was examined using immunohistochemistry and in situ hybridization. The possible role of autophagy in osimertinib resistance was analyzed using immune blot, immune fluorescence staining and immunohistochemistry. This study found that immunohistochemical staining (IHC) showed CAGE expression in more than 50% of patients with pulmonary adenocarcinomas (pADCs). CAGE expression was increased in pADCs after the acquisition of EGFR-TKIs resistance. High expression of CAGE was correlated with shorter overall survival and progression free survival in patients with pADCs. Thus, CAGE mediates osimertinib resistance and predicts poor prognosis in patients with pADCs. Osimertinib-resistant non-small cell lung cancer cells (PC-9\/OSI) were established and mechanistic studies of CAGE-mediated osimertinib resistance were performed. PC-9\/OSI cells showed increased autophagic flux and CAGE expression compared with parental sensitive PC-9 cells. PC-9\/OSI cells showed higher tumorigenic, metastatic, and angiogenic potential compared with parental PC-9 cells. CAGE CRISPR-Cas9 cell lines showed decreased autophagic flux, invasion, migration potential, and tumorigenic potential compared with PC-9\/OSI cells in vitro and in vivo. CAGE plays a crucial role in the cancer progression by modulating autophagy and can predict the poor prognosis of patients with pulmonary adenocarcinomas. Our findings propose CAGE as a potential therapeutic target for developing anticancer drugs that can overcome osimertinib resistance.","keywords":[],"journal":"Scientific reports","publication_date":1695340800000,"authors":[{"lastname":"Yeon","firstname":"Minjeong","initials":"M","affiliation":"Department of Biochemistry, College of Natural Sciences, Kangwon National University, Chuncheon, South Korea.\nThe Wistar Institute, 3601 Spruce Street, Philadelphia, PA, 19104, USA."},{"lastname":"Lee","firstname":"Hankyu","initials":"H","affiliation":"L-Base Company, Seoul, South Korea."},{"lastname":"Yeo","firstname":"Jeongseon","initials":"J","affiliation":"Department of Biochemistry, College of Natural Sciences, Kangwon National University, Chuncheon, South Korea.\nPaean Biotech Company, Seoul, South Korea."},{"lastname":"Jeong","firstname":"Myeong Seon","initials":"MS","affiliation":"Department of Biochemistry, College of Natural Sciences, Kangwon National University, Chuncheon, South Korea.\nChuncheon Center, Korea Basic Science Institute, Chuncheon, Korea."},{"lastname":"Jung","firstname":"Hyun Suk","initials":"HS","affiliation":"Department of Biochemistry, College of Natural Sciences, Kangwon National University, Chuncheon, South Korea."},{"lastname":"Lee","firstname":"Hyerim","initials":"H","affiliation":"L-Base Company, Seoul, South Korea."},{"lastname":"Shim","firstname":"Kyeonghee","initials":"K","affiliation":"Department of Biochemistry, College of Natural Sciences, Kangwon National University, Chuncheon, South Korea."},{"lastname":"Jo","firstname":"Hyein","initials":"H","affiliation":"Department of Biochemistry, College of Natural Sciences, Kangwon National University, Chuncheon, South Korea."},{"lastname":"Jeon","firstname":"Doyong","initials":"D","affiliation":"L-Base Company, Seoul, South Korea.

Despite the undeniable benefit derived from adjuvant TT, the optimal duration of TT and the appropriate managing of the relapse remain open questions. Furthermore, neoadjuvant TT is emerging as valuable, particularly in breast cancer, and ongoing studies evaluate TT in the perioperative setting for early-stage NSCLC.

Unfortunately, due to the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment of pancreatic cancer, the benefits of immunotherapy for patients with advanced pancreatic cancer are still unclear. Here, we present two cases of advanced pancreatic cancer being controlled by immunotherapy, with pathological diagnoses of ductal adenocarcinoma and acinar cell carcinoma, respectively. Next-generation sequencing (NGS) of both patients is high tumor mutation burden (tumor mutation burden-High) and microsatellite stable. The patient with pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma was diagnosed as a locally advanced disease (stage III). She received irreversible electroporation, used the programmed death receptor-1 (PD-1) inhibitor (pembrolizumab) combined with chemotherapy (S-1), and then used only the PD-1 inhibitor as a maintenance treatment. As a result, the patient's lesion was significantly reduced, with a partial response time of up to 31\u2009months. The patient with acinar cell carcinoma was diagnosed as a metastatic disease (stage IV), next-generation sequencing revealed mutations in SMAD4 and KMT2D, and two chemotherapy regimens were used unsuccessfully. Then, the combination of chemotherapy with PD-1 (tislelizumab) and vascular endothelial growth factor\/vascular endothelial growth factor receptor (anlotinib) inhibitors were used, and the lesions of the patient were significantly reduced, and the progression-free survival after immunotherapy was 19\u2009months. In advanced pancreatic cancer, a prognosis of this magnitude is rare. Our cases reveal the potential of immunotherapy as a cornerstone treatment in the management of advanced pancreatic cancer.","keywords":[],"journal":"Anti-cancer drugs","publication_date":1704758400000,"authors":[{"lastname":"Qiu","firstname":"Lijie","initials":"L","affiliation":"Department of Oncology, Sun Yat-sen University First Affiliated Hospital.\nDepartment of Radiology, Sun Yat-sen University Sixth Affiliated Hospital."},{"lastname":"Liu","firstname":"Chen","initials":"C","affiliation":"Department of Radiology, Third Affiliated Hospital of Sun Yat-Sen University, Guangzhou, Guangdong Province, China."},{"lastname":"Li","firstname":"Heping","initials":"H","affiliation":"Department of Oncology, Sun Yat-sen University First Affiliated Hospital."}],"methods":null,"conclusions":null,"results":null,"copyrights":"Copyright \u00a9 2024 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc.

In BRCA-associated cancers such as breast, ovarian, pancreas and prostate, this phenotype confers sensitivity to PARP inhibitors and platinum-therapies. Somatic reversion mutations restoring BRCA1\/2 function mediate resistance, and have exclusively been reported in BRCA-associated tumors. In this study, we analyze matched tumor and normal sequencing from 31,927 patients and identify 846 (2.7%) patients with germline BRCA1\/2 variants across 43 different cancer types, including 11 with somatic reversion mutations. While nine are in BRCA-associated tumors, we find two reversion mutations in non-BRCA-associated histologies, namely lung and esophagogastric adenocarcinomas. Both were detected following platinum therapy. Whole exome sequencing confirms the homologous recombination deficiency phenotype of these tumors. While reversion mutations arise in all BRCA-associated cancer types, here we show that reversion mutations arising post-platinum in non-BRCA associated histologies, while rare, may indicate BRCA1\/2 mediated tumorigenesis.","keywords":[],"journal":"Nature communications","publication_date":1669248000000,"authors":[{"lastname":"Murciano-Goroff","firstname":"Yonina R","initials":"YR","affiliation":"Department of Medicine, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY, USA."},{"lastname":"Schram","firstname":"Alison M","initials":"AM","affiliation":"Department of Medicine, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY, USA.\nWeill Cornell Medical College, New York, NY, USA."},{"lastname":"Rosen","firstname":"Ezra Y","initials":"EY","affiliation":"Department of Medicine, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY, USA.\nWeill Cornell Medical College, New York, NY, USA.\nMarie-Jos\u00e9e and Henry R.

We assess the antitumor activity of neoadjuvant and adjuvant pembrolizumab plus chemotherapy in patients with locally advanced resectable gastric or gastro-oesophageal adenocarcinoma.\nThe KEYNOTE-585 study is a multicentre, randomised, placebo-controlled, double-blind, phase 3 study done at 143 medical centres in 24 countries. Eligible patients were aged 18 years or older with untreated, locally advanced, resectable gastric or gastro-oesophageal adenocarcinoma, and an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status 0-1. Patients were randomly assigned (1:1) by an interactive voice response system and integrated web response system to neoadjuvant pembrolizumab 200 mg intravenously or placebo (saline) plus cisplatin-based doublet chemotherapy (main cohort) every 3 weeks for 3 cycles, followed by surgery, adjuvant pembrolizumab or placebo plus chemotherapy for 3 cycles, then adjuvant pembrolizumab or placebo for 11 cycles. A small cohort was also randomly assigned (1:1) to pembrolizumab or placebo plus fluorouracil, docetaxel, and oxaliplatin (FLOT)-based chemotherapy (FLOT cohort) every 2 weeks for four cycles, followed by surgery, adjuvant pembrolizumab, or placebo plus FLOT for four cycles, then adjuvant pembrolizumab or placebo for 11 cycles. Patients were stratified by geographic region, tumour stage, and chemotherapy backbone. Primary endpoints were pathological complete response (reviewed centrally), event-free survival (reviewed by the investigator), and overall survival in the intention-to-treat population, and safety assessed in all patients who received at least one dose of study treatment. The study is registered at ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT03221426, and is closed to accrual.\nBetween Oct 9, 2017, and Jan 25, 2021, of 1254 patients screened, 804 were randomly assigned to the main cohort, of whom 402 were assigned to the pembrolizumab plus cisplatin-based chemotherapy group and 402 to the placebo plus cisplatin-based chemotherapy group, and 203 to the FLOT cohort, of whom 100 were assigned to the pembrolizumab plus FLOT group and 103 to placebo plus FLOT group. In the main cohort of 804 participants, 575 (72%) were male and 229 (28%) were female. In the main cohort, after median follow-up of 47\u00b77 months (IQR 38\u00b70-54\u00b78), pembrolizumab was superior to placebo for pathological complete response (52 [12\u00b79%; 95% CI 9\u00b78-16\u00b76] of 402 vs eight [2\u00b70%; 0\u00b79-3\u00b79] of 402; difference 10\u00b79%, 95% CI 7\u00b75 to 14\u00b78; p<0\u00b700001). Median event-free survival was longer with pembrolizumab versus placebo (44\u00b74 months, 95% CI 33\u00b70 to not reached vs 25\u00b73 months, 20\u00b76 to 33\u00b79; hazard ratio [HR] 0\u00b781, 95% CI 0\u00b767 to 0\u00b799; p=0\u00b70198) but did not meet the threshold for statistical significance (p=0\u00b70178). Median overall survival was 60\u00b77 months (95% CI 51\u00b75 to not reached) in the pembrolizumab group versus 58\u00b70 months (41\u00b75 to not reached) in the placebo group (HR 0\u00b790, 95% CI 0\u00b773 to 1\u00b712; p=0\u00b7174). Grade 3 or worse adverse events of any cause occurred in 312 (78%) of 399 patients in the pembrolizumab group and 297 (74%) of 400 patients in the placebo group; the most common were nausea (240 [60%] vs 247 [62%]), anaemia (168 [42%] vs 158 [40%]), and decreased appetite (163 [41%] vs 172 [43%]). Treatment-related serious adverse events were reported in 102 (26%) and 97 (24%) patients. Treatment-related adverse events that led to death occurred in four (1%) patients in the pembrolizumab group (interstitial ischaemia, pneumonia, decreased appetite, and acute kidney injury [n=1 each]) and two (<1%) patients in the placebo group (neutropenic sepsis and neutropenic colitis [n=1 each]).\nAlthough neoadjuvant and adjuvant pembrolizumab versus placebo improved the pathological complete response, it did not translate to significant improvement in event-free survival in patients with untreated, locally advanced resectable gastric or gastro-oesophageal cancer.\nMerck Sharp & Dohme.","keywords":[],"journal":"The Lancet.

They cause malnutrition, performance status (PS) deterioration, and difficulty in the oral administration of antitumor drug tablets. A 78-year-old female patient with lung adenocarcinoma, harboring an epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)-sensitizing mutation, experienced dysphagia due to an esophageal stricture caused by retrotracheal lymph node metastases. Osimertinib is a third-generation EGFR-tyrosine kinase inhibitor that is efficacious against EGFR-sensitizing mutations. The esophageal stricture hampered food intake and oral administration of osimertinib, causing severe malnutrition and deterioration to PS 3. Esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) revealed severe and entire circumferential stenosis (7 cm in length) of the upper esophagus without mucosal abnormality. A nasogastric tube was inserted under EGD guidance, and an osimertinib suspension was administered accordingly: a tablet containing 80 mg of osimertinib was suspended in 50 mL of sterile hot water (55 \u2103) for ten minutes, and the suspension was administered through a nasogastric tube once daily. Dysphagia improved 15 days after the introduction of osimertinib. After 21 days, the patient could take foods and drugs orally, and her PS improved to 1.

Pembrolizumab, a monoclonal antibody, has been recently approved in Japan for treatment of MSI-H solid tumors. Lynch syndrome is a frequent hereditary cancer predisposition syndrome. It is linked to an increased risk of various types of cancer, including colorectal and endometrial cancer, and is closely related to MSI-H. We present the case of a 55-year-old woman who was diagnosed with duodenal cancer. Biopsy findings revealed MSI-H, and pembrolizumab therapy was initiated because the tumor was in contact with the left renal vein and had metastasized to the mesenteric lymph nodes of the small intestine. Subsequently, after completing two courses of pembrolizumab therapy, the patient developed duodenal stenosis and underwent surgery. Pathological analysis of the resected specimen revealed no evidence of malignancy.

However, MC originating from the small intestine is exceedingly rare, with only nine cases described in the literature. Based on previous cases, surgical resection is currently the mainstay of treatment for those with localized disease. We report the first case of a patient who presented with unresectable microsatellite instability-high (MSI-H) MC of the duodenum and was instead treated with pembrolizumab.\nA 50-year-old man with history of adenocarcinoma of the proximal descending colon status post hemicolectomy and adjuvant treatment with chemotherapy and family history of Lynch syndrome presented with abdominal pain for two weeks. Computed tomography (CT) abdomen\/pelvis revealed a 10.7 cm by 4.3 cm mass in the mid-portion of the duodenum abutting against the pancreatic head. Esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) demonstrated circumferential, partially obstructing, intrinsic stenosis of the duodenum with ampullary involvement and likely invasion into the pancreatic head and common bile duct. Endoscopic biopsy of the primary tumor revealed poorly differentiated MC. Immunohistochemical staining showed loss of MLH1 and PMS2 expression. Staging with CT chest showed no evidence of disease. Positron emission tomography (PET) scan redemonstrated circumferential duodenal wall thickening and hypermetabolic activity with standardized uptake value (SUV) max of 26.4, as well as PET-avid epigastric, retroperitoneal, and periaortic lymphadenopathy suggestive of metastasis. He was started on pembrolizumab and found to have stable disease on repeat imaging along with significant improvement in symptoms and performance status.\nDue to the rarity of the tumor, there is no standardized approach to treatment. All patients in previously published cases underwent surgical resection. However, our patient was deemed a poor surgical candidate. Given his previous history of colon cancer and treatment with platinum-based therapy, he qualified for pembrolizumab as first line therapy for his MSI-H tumor. To our knowledge, this is the first report of MC of the duodenum as well as the first MC to be treated with pembrolizumab in the first line setting. In order to corroborate the use of immune checkpoint inhibitors as a treatment option for MC of the colon or small intestine, the aggregation of existing and future case data in this unique patient group is certainly warranted.","keywords":["Lynch syndrome","case report","duodenum","immune checkpoint inhibitor","medullary carcinoma (MC)","pembrolizumab"],"journal":"Journal of gastrointestinal oncology","publication_date":1684368000000,"authors":[{"lastname":"Liu","firstname":"Louisa","initials":"L","affiliation":"Department of Internal Medicine, University of California, Riverside School of Medicine, Riverside, California, USA."},{"lastname":"Kaur","firstname":"Simmer","initials":"S","affiliation":"Department of Medical Oncology\/Hematology, Loma Linda University Medical Center, Loma Linda, California, USA."},{"lastname":"Dayyani","firstname":"Farshid","initials":"F","affiliation":"Division of Hematology\/Oncology, University of California, Irvine Health, Irvine, California, USA."},{"lastname":"Cho","firstname":"May","initials":"M","affiliation":"Division of Hematology\/Oncology, University of California, Irvine Health, Irvine, California, USA."},{"lastname":"Ran-Castillo","firstname":"Dani","initials":"D","affiliation":"Department of Medical Oncology\/Hematology, Loma Linda University Medical Center, Loma Linda, California, USA."},{"lastname":"Chong","firstname":"Esther","initials":"E","affiliation":"Department of Medical Oncology\/Hematology, Loma Linda University Medical Center, Loma Linda, California, USA."},{"lastname":"Khandelwal","firstname":"Keerti","initials":"K","affiliation":"Department of Medical Oncology\/Hematology, Loma Linda University Medical Center, Loma Linda, California, USA."},{"lastname":"Demisse","firstname":"Rahel","initials":"R","affiliation":"Department of Medical Oncology\/Hematology, Loma Linda University Medical Center, Loma Linda, California, USA."}],"methods":null,"conclusions":null,"results":null,"copyrights":"2023 Journal of Gastrointestinal Oncology.

Neoadjuvant immunotherapy has shown potential in improving resectability. Additionally, advancements in surgical techniques, including complete mesocolic excision (CME) with central vascular ligation (CVL), have contributed to better outcomes for right-sided colon cancer. This case report aims to demonstrate the successful laparoscopic resection of initial appearing irresectable colon cancer with suspected duodenal involvement.\nA 70-year-old female presented with an irresectable mismatch repair deficient (dMMR) adenocarcinoma of the ascending colon with suspected duodenal ingrowth. Neoadjuvant treatment with pembrolizumab and ataluren resulted in a significant response, allowing for surgical resection. A laparoscopic right hemicolectomy with CME, including CVL, intracorporeal anastomosis and extraction through a Pfannenstiel incision, was performed. Additionally, the serosal layer of the duodenum was shaved after observing the absence of intraluminal invasion. Postoperatively, transient gastroparesis occurred, but overall outcomes were favourable.\nThis case emphasizes the potential of immunotherapy in improving resectability for irresectable dMMR colon cancer with suspected involvement of surrounding organs. The combination of neoadjuvant therapy and advanced surgical techniques, such as CME with CVL, shows promise in achieving favourable clinical outcomes. However, further studies are needed to validate the effectiveness and safety of this combined approach in a larger cohort of patients.\nThe successful laparoscopic resection of initially irresectable dMMR colon cancer with duodenal involvement, following neoadjuvant immunotherapy, demonstrated promising outcomes. This case advocates for further exploration of neoadjuvant treatments' efficacy, coupled with advanced surgical techniques, in managing locally advanced right-sided colon cancer.","keywords":["Case report","Deficient mismatch repair","Locally advanced cancer","Neoadjuvant therapy","Right hemicolectomy","Right-sided colon cancer"],"journal":"International journal of surgery case reports","publication_date":1702512000000,"authors":[{"lastname":"Gr\u00fcter","firstname":"Alexander A J","initials":"AAJ","affiliation":"Amsterdam UMC location Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam, Department of Surgery, De Boelelaan 1117, Amsterdam, the Netherlands; Cancer Center Amsterdam, Treatment and quality of life, Amsterdam, the Netherlands.
